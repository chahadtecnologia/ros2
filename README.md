# Project Development with ROS 2

### This repository is designed to centralize the development of projects using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System). The goal is to leverage the platform's tools and libraries to create robotics solutions, ranging from simulation to real hardware control.

## What is ROS 2?

### In general terms, ROS 2 acts as a specialized middleware for robotics. Its primary role is to provide a standardized communication infrastructure that allows different parts of a robotic system (sensors, actuators, and algorithms) to "talk" to each other efficiently and in a distributed manner.

### Through a node-based architecture and the DDS (Data Distribution Service) communication protocol, ROS 2 facilitates:

- **Modularity**: Breaking down complex tasks into small, independent processes.
- **Scalability**: The ability to run systems across multiple processors or machines.
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Focusing on software development without the need to rewrite basic drivers.
- **Reliability**: Advanced features for real-time systems and mission-critical applications.

### This space will serve as a foundation for implementing packages, configuration files, and simulations, exploring the potential of ROS 2 in building intelligent and autonomous robots.
